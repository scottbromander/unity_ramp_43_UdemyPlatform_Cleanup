# Udemy Platformer Finishing Course 
This course focuses on taking a basic platformer and adding effects to enrich the experience. Overall, the course is OK as there are certainly some methods in here that would be considered not efficient, but at the heart of the course is thinking about the player experience. Which should be central to the decision making process of game developers. The things that the course does well, is that it talks a great deal about subtle player feedback to elevate the whole player experience. This is done by greating small feedback loops on different events, such as the player firing, hitting enemies, and hit feedback.
